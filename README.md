# Data-Structures
****IMPORTANT****
If you are a student in Data Structures or any computer science course of any year, do not copy my code. Rutgers has the Academic Honesty Policy for a reason and using my code in any way shape or form is a violation of that policy. I am not responsible if you get in trouble for using my work because I did not allow you to do it in the first place. The only reason my code is on my github is to show companies and anyone looking at my github for recreational and employment purposes my thought process and how I write and structure my programs. 


All my code and projects for the CS112 Data Structures and Algorithms class at Rutgers University
